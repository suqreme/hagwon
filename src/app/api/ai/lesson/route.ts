## Welcome to Counting!

Hi there! Today we're going to learn how to count from 1 to 10. Counting is one of the most important math skills you'll ever learn!

## What is Counting?
Counting means saying numbers in order to find out how many things there are.

## Let's Learn the Numbers 1-10

**1 (One)** - Hold up 1 finger
**2 (Two)** - Hold up 2 fingers  
**3 (Three)** - Hold up 3 fingers
**4 (Four)** - Hold up 4 fingers
**5 (Five)** - Hold up 5 fingers
**6 (Six)** - Hold up 6 fingers
**7 (Seven)** - Hold up 7 fingers
**8 (Eight)** - Hold up 8 fingers
**9 (Nine)** - Hold up 9 fingers
**10 (Ten)** - Hold up 10 fingers

## Practice Activities

### Activity 1: Count Your Toys
Look around and find some toys or objects. Count them:
- 1 toy car
- 2 toy cars  
- 3 toy cars
- Keep going up to 10!

### Activity 2: Count and Touch
Touch each object as you count:
- Touch 1 book and say "One"
- Touch 2 books and say "One, Two"
- Keep going!

### Activity 3: Count Your Steps
Take steps while counting:
- 1 step, 2 steps, 3 steps... up to 10!

## Important Tips
- Always start with 1
- Say each number clearly
- Count slowly at first
- Use your fingers to help
- Practice every day!

## Let's Practice Together
Count these objects:
üçé (1 apple)
üçéüçé (2 apples)  
üçéüçéüçé (3 apples)

Can you count them? 1, 2, 3!

## Remember
- Counting helps us know "how many"
- Practice makes perfect
- You're doing great!

Great job learning to count! Next, we'll learn to count even higher numbers!

## Counting to 20 - Let's Go Higher!

Now that you know how to count to 10, let's learn to count all the way to 20!

## Review: Numbers 1-10
Let's quickly count together: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

## New Numbers: 11-20
**11 (Eleven)** - This is 10 + 1 more
**12 (Twelve)** - This is 10 + 2 more
**13 (Thirteen)** - This is 10 + 3 more
**14 (Fourteen)** - This is 10 + 4 more
**15 (Fifteen)** - This is 10 + 5 more
**16 (Sixteen)** - This is 10 + 6 more
**17 (Seventeen)** - This is 10 + 7 more
**18 (Eighteen)** - This is 10 + 8 more
**19 (Nineteen)** - This is 10 + 9 more
**20 (Twenty)** - This is 2 groups of 10

## Practice Activities
Count objects around you from 1 to 20. Try counting:
- Your fingers and toes (that's 20!)
- Blocks or toys
- Books on a shelf

## Memory Tip
The teens (11-19) all end in "teen" except eleven and twelve. Remember:
- ThirTEEN, FourTEEN, FifTEEN, SixTEEN, SevenTEEN, EighTEEN, NineTEEN

Great job! You can now count to 20!

## Introduction to Addition

Addition means putting groups together to find the total!

## What is Addition?
When you have some objects and you get more objects, addition helps you find out how many you have altogether.

## The Plus Sign (+)
The + sign means "add" or "put together"
The = sign means "equals" or "the same as"

## Let's Start Simple

### Adding with 1
- 1 + 1 = 2 (1 apple + 1 apple = 2 apples)
- 2 + 1 = 3 (2 cats + 1 cat = 3 cats)
- 3 + 1 = 4 (3 books + 1 book = 4 books)

### Adding with 2
- 1 + 2 = 3 (1 ball + 2 balls = 3 balls)
- 2 + 2 = 4 (2 dogs + 2 dogs = 4 dogs)  
- 3 + 2 = 5 (3 cars + 2 cars = 5 cars)

## Practice Activities

### Use Your Fingers
Hold up fingers to add:
- Hold up 2 fingers on one hand, 3 on the other
- Count all your fingers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- So 2 + 3 = 5!

### Use Objects
Get some blocks, toys, or snacks:
- Put 3 blocks in one pile
- Put 2 blocks in another pile  
- Push them together and count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- So 3 + 2 = 5!

## Remember
- Addition means "putting together"
- Count everything to find the answer
- Practice with objects you can touch
- Start with small numbers

Great job learning addition!
